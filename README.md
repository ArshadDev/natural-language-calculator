# Natural Language Calculator (Text Based Calculator)

# Problem
Write a text-based console application to perform simple natural language calculations.
For example, if the user enters the text ‘two plus four’ the program would output the value ‘6’.

# Running Application
Application.java is the entry point to run the application


# Executing Test Cases
Junit Test cases have been added to validate functionality

# Please find below assumptions made to while implementing this application

*	Accepted Numbers are whole numbers from ZERO to TEN only (both included)
*	Accepted Operators are only : 
*	Add (+) : add, plus
*	Subtract (-) : subtract, minus, less
*	Multiply (*) : multiplied-by, times
*	Divide (/) : divided-by, over

*	Final result is to be displayed on console only, hence it is kept/converted String
*	No Special characetrs are allowed in valid expression (user input)

*	User Input/expression is valid if it satisfies below all conditions
*	expression should not be blank or null
*	expression should start and end with Numbers
*	expression should not contains any token/value other than accepted Numbers and Operators
*	expression should contain odd number of tokens
